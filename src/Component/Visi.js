                Indonesia is a distinct country. 
                And with all the massive potential that we have, 
                Indonesia deserves to develop forward and upward on 
                the global competition arena. A call of collective 
                efforts is what Indonesia actually needed to thrive 
                in becoming a greater nation we will be.
